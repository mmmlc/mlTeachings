They’re called the *weights* or the *trainable parameters* of the layer (the $\\texttt{kernel}$ and $\\texttt{bias}$ attributes, respectively). These weights contain the information learned by the network from exposure to training data. Initially, these weight matrices are filled with small random values (a step called random initialization). Of course, there’s no reason to expect that $\\texttt{relu(dot(W, input) + b)}$, when $\\texttt{W}$ and $\\texttt{b}$ are random, would yield any useful representations. The resulting representations are meaningless but they are a starting point. What comes next is **to gradually adjust these weights, based on a feedback signal**. This gradual adjustment, also called training, is basically \"**the learning**\" that machine learning is all about.\n",

The network has *learned* to map its inputs to correct targets. From afar, it may look like magic, but when reduced to elementary steps, it turns out to be simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 sounds easy enough: just I/O code. Steps 2 and 3 are merely the application of a handful of tensor operations, so you could implement these steps purely from what you learned in the previous section. The difficult part is step 4: updating the network’s\n",

In practice, a neural-network function consists of many tensor operations chained together, each of which has a simple, known derivative.
